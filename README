Regarding splpmu.f, splpmn.f,  splpmu.f, and  splpmn.f
      
These are part of the slatec library (all available from NETLIB).
and are all subsidiary to splp --- a slatex linear programming
routine. The originals do not compile under gfortran due to ancient
FORTRAN ASSIGN statements. I have hacked these four routines
 and replaced the ASSIGNS with a set of GOTO statements.
I keep them copies of them here. The are not actually compiled into 
 libmylib.

1:     programs written by me
1.1:   myGaussElim - Gaussian elimination with scaled pivoting, matrix is arbitrary N by N.
       Gaussian elimination program: fairly well tested, but use linpack or lapack instead!
       It's here to be developed into something else for an RT application:
       In this application the matrix elements will depend on the RHS!
       So myGaussElim assumes we have only one right hand side, and we don't bother
       storing multipliers or returning permutation vector.
       We have actually overwritten matrix(i,j) with zero values where the upper triangular
       is zero --- not necessary, but makes things more obvious at this stage.
