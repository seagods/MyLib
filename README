Regarding splpmu.f, splpmn.f,  splpmu.f, and  splpmn.f
      
These are part of the slatec library (all available from NETLIB).
and are all subsidiary to splp --- a slatex linear programming
routine. The originals do not compile under gfortran due to ancient
FORTRAN ASSIGN statements. I have hacked these four routines
 and replaced the ASSIGNS with a set of GOTO statements.
I keep them copies of them here. The are not actually compiled into 
 libmylib.


Programs actually compiled into libmylib:
 
1:  programs written by me
2:  my modifications of programs written by other people
3:  programs  written by other people


1:     programs written by me
       myGaussElim, myMonic2, myMonic3, myMonic4.
1.1:   myGaussElim - Gaussian elimination with scaled pivoting, matrix
       is arbitrary N by N. Gaussian elimination program: fairly well
       tested, but use linpack or lapack instead!
       It's here to be developed into something else for an RT application:
       In this application the matrix elements will depend on the RHS!
       So myGaussElim assumes we have only one right hand side, and we don't
       bother storing multipliers or returning permutation vector.  We have 
       actually overwritten matrix(i,j) with zero values where the upper triangular
       is zero --- not necessary, but makes things more obvious at this stage. 
1.2:   myMonic2.
       Solves a monic quadratic polynomial with one step Newton-Raphson. Trivial I know
1.3    myMonic3: Solves a monic cubic polynomial using Abramowitz and Stegun's analytical 
       formula (Page.17 of Handbook of Mathematical Functions) with Newton-Raphson.
       (Last step can be necessary under certain circumstances)
       Needs more work, hope it will "do" for now.   
1.4    myMonic4: Analytical solution a monic quartic polynomial: This time we do NOT
       use Abramowitz and Stegun's, Again with Newton-Raphson polish at end.
       Needs more work, hope it will "do" for now.  
       

2:  my modifications of programs written by other people
    mydbesy.f //minor hack of slatec routine to get to compile with gfortran


3:  programs  written by other people - no modification
